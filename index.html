                    BlockSec, a security company, reported an attack on the Euler Finance loan protocol and the theft of
                    $177 million through four transactions. Subsequently, two more transactions were made, bringing the
                    total stolen assets to $197 million. This flash loan attack caused disruption in the operations of
                    11 other DeFi platforms, including Balancer.

                <P class="mt-1" style="font-family:serif">Euler Finance is a protocol that operates as a permissionless
                    lending protocol. Its primary goal is to facilitate lending and borrowing of various
                    cryptocurrencies for users. The UK-based tech startup utilizes mathematical principles to develop
                    non-custodial protocols on Ethereum and other blockchain networks, with a focus on achieving high
                    performance.
                </P>
                <p class="mt-1" style="font-family:serif">Euler Protocol allows users to add different tokens to this
                    platform by using Uniswap's version 3 smart contracts. All assets that have a WETH pair on one side
                    can be added by users of Euler. The Euler platform uses a list of assets in order to reduce users'
                    risk. Users can select any of these assets from the list according to their needs and use them.</p>

            <p class="mt-1 mt-3" style="font-family:serif">On 13 March 2023 at 08:56:35 AM +UTC, DeFi lending protocol
                Euler
                Finance experienced a Flash Loan Attack.</p>
            <p class="mt-1 " style="font-family:serif">Based on on-chain data analysis, the attacker has successfully
                executed multiple transactions resulting in the theft of approximately $196 million, making it the
                largest
                hack of 2023 thus far. Stolen assets include several million worth of DAI, USDC, Staked Ether (StETH),
                and
                Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).</p>
            <p class="mt-1 " style="font-family:serif">The attack was possible due to a lack of liquidity checks in the
                donateToReserves function of the Etoken. The attacker executed multiple calls with different currencies
                to
                generate profit, resulting in a massive loss of $196 million across six different tokens. Currently, the
                funds remain in the attacker’s account.</p>
            <p class="mt-1 " style="font-family:serif">1. The attacker first borrowed 30 million DAI through a flash
                loan
                from Aave and then deployed two contracts: one for lending and one for liquidation.</p>
            <p class="mt-1 " style="font-family:serif">2. The attacker then called the deposit function and pledged 20
                million DAI to the Euler Protocol contract, receiving 19.5 million eDAI in return.</p>
            <p class="mt-1 " style="font-family:serif">3. The Euler Protocol allows users to borrow up to 10 times their
                deposit by calling the mint function. The attacker leveraged this capability to borrow 195.6 million
                eDAI
                and 200 million dDAI.</p>
            <p class="mt-1 " style="font-family:serif">4. The attacker called the repay function using the remaining 10
                million DAI borrowed through the flash loan to repay their debt and destroy 10 million dDAI. They then
                proceeded to call the mint function again to borrow 195.6 million eDAI and 200 million dDAI.

            </p>
            <p class="mt-1 " style="font-family:serif">5. The attacker then called the donateToReserves function and
                donated
                10 times the amount needed to repay their debt, sending 100 million eDAI. They then called the liquidate
                function to initiate the liquidation process and obtained 310 million dDAI and 250 million eDAI.

            </p>
            <p class="mt-1 " style="font-family:serif">6. The attacker called the withdraw function and obtained 38.9
                million DAI, which they used to repay the 30 million DAI borrowed through the flash loan. They profited
                8.87
                million DAI from the attack.

            <p class="mt-5 mb-5" style="font-family:serif">The hack is made possible due to the flawed logic its
                donation and liquidation. Specifically, the donateToReserves needs to ensure the donator is still
                over-collateralized. And liquidation needs to ensure the *correct* conversion rate from borrow to
                collateral asset.</p>

            <p class="mt-5" style="font-family:serif">TVL (Total Value Locked) is a metric used to measure the value
                locked into a decentralized finance (DeFi) application or protocol. It is usually calculated by adding
                the total value of cryptocurrencies or tokens locked in the protocol. TVL is an important metric for
                DeFi projects as it indicates the amount of capital invested in the application or protocol and can be
                used to compare the success of projects in the DeFi space.</p>

            <p class="mt-2" style="font-family:serif">The TVL of Euler Finance changed after the hack because the
                hackers were able to access and exploit the smart contract, allowing them to withdraw a large amount of
                funds. This caused a significant decrease in the total value locked (TVL) in the platform.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-2" style="font-family:serif">
                TVL (Total Value Locked) may have initially decreased after the platform was hacked, but the charts
                demonstrate a significant increase in this amount. This could be due to security companies running more
                hacking tests to ensure the platform is secure. Additionally, the amount of deposits, withdrawals, and
                borrowing on this platform has risen drastically after the hack, suggesting that users are moving their
                assets to the platform out of concern for their safety, and this has resulted in a higher volume of
                activity.

                    a sudden drop in the value of the Euler (EUL) token. The value of the token dropped 44.2% overnight,
                    from $6.56 to $3.37. This drastic decrease in value has continued, and the token is now being traded
                    at $2.74, meaning that it has lost almost 55% of its value in less than two days. This sudden drop
                    in value has likely had a major impact on investors and those who own the token.


                    The future of the Euler token is uncertain, and it remains to be seen if the value will recover or
                    continue to fall. Investors are likely keeping an eye on the market, looking for any signs of
                    recovery and hoping that the value of the token will eventually rebound. Until then, the market
                    remains volatile and those invested in the Euler</p>

                            both decentralized and centralized. This suggests that users were transferring their $EUL to
                            exchanges in order to sell it or swap it for other tokens.

                            been attracted to the decentralized exchanges because they offer a wider range of tokens
                            than the centralized exchanges. </p>

                        The recent Hack Day event has caused a surge in activity on the Euler Protocol, with a large
                        influx of users performing transactions.

                        It appears that these users were trying to withdraw their assets from the platform in order to
                        protect themselves from any potential future risks associated with the exploit.

                        Following the attack, all Euler contract activity has come to a standstill, and there has been
                        no further transactions on any of the contracts.

                        This can be verified by watching activity charts in this article and also dune dashboards.


                        The exploit attack has had a notable impact on the Euler Protocol, as it has caused a drastic
                        increased in activity and transactions on the platform, due to users wanting to protect their
                        assets. As a result, the Euler Protocol has been put on hold, until it is safe to use again.</p>

                        describing the recent hacking of the Euler platform, which is a cryptocurrency platform. After
                        the hacking, many holders of the Euler tokens decided to convert their tokens into other assets,
                        with the most popular being WETH. Additionally, some holders chose to convert their tokens into
                        USDC and DC tokens, but the majority opted for WETH. This shows that people are wary of the
                        security of the Euler platform, and are seeking safer alternatives for their investments.

                        also explains the concept of token swapping, which is when holders of a particular asset convert
                        their holdings into another asset. This is usually done for a variety of reasons, such as
                        diversifying their portfolio or taking advantage of price changes in the market. Token swapping
                        can also be used to hedge against potential losses, as holders can switch to a more stable asset
                        if the value of their original asset decreases significantly.

                        discussing the recent hacking of the Euler platform, and how it has caused many holders to
                        switch their tokens into different assets. This highlights the importance of security and the
                        need for platforms to ensure their systems are secure in order to maintain user trust. </p>

                            who exploited their platform for $196 million by transferring them 0 ETH. In their first
                            message, they asked if the hacker would be open to talking about potential next steps.
                            However, when they did not receive a response, they followed up the next day with an
                            ultimatum: return 90% of the funds within 24 hours or they would launch a $1 million reward
                            for information that leads to the hacker's arrest and the return of all funds. This would
                            mean that the hacker would get to keep $19.6 million. Although this might seem like a good
                            deal, many have noted that the hacker has no incentive to follow through with the agreement.
